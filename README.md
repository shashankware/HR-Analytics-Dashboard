# Domain: Human Resources (HR) Analytics/People Analytics

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Organizations across industries are struggling to **retain top talent**. High employee attrition not only leads to increased recruitment and training costs but also affects productivity, team morale, and long-term performance.

However, HR teams often lack the tools and insights to:
- Identify **who is most at risk** of leaving
- Understand **which departments, age groups, or job roles** are most affected
- Uncover patterns in **job satisfaction**, education, and demographics

The challenge lies in transforming raw HR data into **clear, actionable insights** that enable better decision-making.

## ✅ Solution

To address this, I developed an **interactive HR Analytics Dashboard** in **Power BI** that analyzes employee attrition trends using real organizational data.

### 🔹 Key Features of the Dashboard:
- 📊 **Real-time KPIs**: Attrition rate, active employees, average age
- 🧩 **Department-wise breakdown**: Pinpoints where attrition is highest (e.g., Sales)
- 👥 **Age group & gender analysis**: Shows how different demographics are impacted
- 🎯 **Job satisfaction matrix**: Evaluates satisfaction ratings by role
- 🎓 **Education field analysis**: Tracks attrition by academic background
- 🔍 **Attrition by gender & age group combo**: Visual donut charts with percentages
- 🎛️ **Dynamic filters**: Users can slice data by education, age, gender, etc.

### 🔹 Tools & Skills Used:
- Power BI (DAX, visuals, filters, interactions)
- Excel (raw data cleaning)
- UX & storytelling design
- Business intelligence principles
